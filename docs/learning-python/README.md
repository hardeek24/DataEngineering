# learning Python repository

This is intended to cover Python for Data Engineering, but it won't be fully covered,
for some basic python as like data structure, creating functions, comprehensions, you must understand it by exploring from Internet.
This learning materials will mostly cover about underrated/not being used frequently python knowledge, so people might be unaware of it.
