# Pytest - the `assert` statement

The `assert` statement in Python is used for debugging and testing purposes. It allows us to check if a condition is `True`, and if it's not, it will **Raise** an `Exception` called `AssertionError`.
This can be very helpful in writing unit tests to verify if the expected results match the actual results.

```python
assert condition, message
```

## Check it out

- Let's see below `addition.py` and its test case.

```python title="addition.py"
def addition(x, y):
    return x + y
```

```python title="test_file.py"
from addition import addition

def test_addition_int():
    assert addition(4, 5) == 9
    assert addition(12, 2) == 14

def test_addition_str():
    assert addition('a', 'b') == 'ab'
```

- to test it out, run

```bash
docker build -t pytest-assertion docs/learning-python/unit-testing/assertion/ && docker run pytest-assertion
```

## Result

```bash
